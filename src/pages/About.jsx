          I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong <strong>research-driven orientation</strong> in 
          Machine Learning, Data Analytics and intelligent system development. My academic background 
          and project experience focus on bridging theoretical research with practical implementation, 
          where I design, experiment with, and optimize data-driven models and full-stack systems to address 
          real-world problems. I have worked on research-oriented projects spanning healthcare management 
          systems, IoT- and ML-based smart agriculture solutions, predictive analytics, and intelligent 
          automation, with an emphasis on model performance, data interpretation, and system scalability.
        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)" }}>
          My interests extend to applied artificial intelligence, data-informed decision-making, and 
          interdisciplinary research, particularly in domains where AI can enhance efficiency, 
          accessibility, and societal impact. I am experienced in collaborating across software 
          engineering and research workflows, documenting findings, and translating complex 
          technical concepts into clear, actionable insights. Driven by curiosity and continuous 
          learning, I aspire to contribute to impactful research initiatives, publish meaningful
           work, and develop intelligent systems that combine robust engineering with strong 
           analytical foundations.
